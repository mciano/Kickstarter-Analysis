# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to find trends

# Overview of Project
This Analysis had the purpose to dive deep on dataset from Crowdfund Campaign since the year of 2009 till 2017. Looking to the details for the Theater outcome by Lunch date and Outcomes based on goals.
##
# Analysis and Challenges
For this analysis was necessary to do a Pivot table to consolidate all information, then was necessary to filter by Category **theater**, sorting by Column Labels **outcomes**, then plot a Pivot Chart Line, it was a challenge to show **canceled outcome as zero on October** but it was possible show the gap looing on Select Data Source **Hidden and Empty Cells**  *Show empty cells as: Gaps* . This was possible to show that none canceled was encountered in October as chart visualization. 
On the other hand, the formula used to count numbers of successful, failed and canceled outcomes was quite challenging using more than 1 criteria, but the result was positive and double checked manually to avoid any mistakes.

# Results
When analysing the Chart of Theater Outcomes by Lunch Date, it was possible to see that May has the most successful outcomes on Theater Category, other thing it that successful outcomes are bigger than failed and canceled outcomes combined.
##
The outcome based on goals can figure that more half of successful Goals for Plays was under $4999, many projects over $20000 tend to fail more than succeed.

Dataset could give us the overall amount that was gathered to each Category and Subcategory, it would be good if we could have a breakdown data by each line that composes the total Category and subcategory to have better raking of bakers amount.
##
It was possible to explore more Statistics tables to test mean, median, standard deviation, as well as upper and lower quartile. Pie chart was a good option to visualize the segments, other possible chart visualization was horizontal bar chart.
